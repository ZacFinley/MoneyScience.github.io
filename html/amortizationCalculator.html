        <p class="description">
            There are 4 elements that make up a mortgage payment: Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance (PITI).<br>
            This only calculates Principal and Interest.<br>
            With an amoritized loan you can pay ahead (denpending on the lender) on the principal which will save you on intereset.<br>
            As you will see by calculating different loan amounts the early part of the loan will always have the highest interest of the loan.<br>
            This is becuase the interest part of the payment is calculated based on the outstanding loan balance * annual interest rate / 12<br>
            Then the if you take the monthly payment amount and subtract the interest amount you will get the principal amount for that payment.<br>
            Sometimes you will hear about sliding down the amoritization schedule.<br>
            This is the spreadsheet that is created here.<br>
            When you pay ahead you can slide down to where the new balance is.<br>
            This will not change your payment amount, it will just get the loan paid off sooner.<br>
            Do not take this result as your official payment.<br>
            Please contact lending providers to get your specific results.
