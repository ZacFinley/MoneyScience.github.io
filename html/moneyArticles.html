                    It took just under 5 years to reach this milestone. In October of my sophomore year of college I was sitting in the library nervous and curious about where I was really going in life. Now at this time I had already picked my degree and was not really questioning my choice there. However, I was trying to figure out how to navigate the rest of life. I had just started living in my first apartment and it was time to really take control of the day-to-day decisions adults make.

                    At this time in my life I had been living at home through grade school and in a dorm room for my freshman year of college. The summer between freshman and sophomore year I was a camp counselor. This is important to understand because I had never been responsible for buying and cooking food, paying bills and holding down a job that was needed to pay for that stuff. In the dorms there was prepared food that I just had to show up for and eat. This was the same at the camp. So this was the time I had to make some changes and start looking forward.

                    In this library I remember looking at my bank account and seeing that I had about $1,200. My grandparents had just put some of that in my account and I knew that I did not want to and could not really on family for my income. At the time I was working as a lifeguard. Fortunatly, my mom had pushed me to get certified in high school and I had already worked as a guard for about 3 years. So that was a fairly easy job to get when I moved to college. A lifeguard only made minimum wage or a dollar or 2 more than that an hour. This was not a bonanza that I was making.
