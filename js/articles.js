The myth that your net worth is how much you make is false. For example to be a millionaire, that means that you own money and property that once you subtract your debts equals $1,000,000.00 or more. If you earn a million dollars a year that is great, however that does not make you a millionaire. If you spend $0.01 of that money (and had no other money with no debt) you now have less than a million dollars which means you are not a millionaire. On the flip side if you earn $50,000.00 a year and you have saved and/or invested to get to the point of having over $1,000,000.00 after deducting your debts then you are now a millionaire without ever earning a million dollars in a single year. <br><br>Assets - Liabilities  = Net Worth"

The principal, which is the amount that was initially borrowed from the lender and the interest, which is the cost of borrowing the principal. There could also be additional fees. This is all plugged into an equation to determine the payment.<br><br>Amortization is a common way of calculating payments for a debt. The debt interest precentage is multiplied by the remaining principal to calculate the dollar amount of interest being paid in the current payment. The payment amount will not change during the life of the debt, but the dollar amount that goes towards the principal will increase after every payment. You can speed up the debt repayment by paying more and requesting that the additional amount goes only to the principal. This will mean that you will save money on interest over the life of the loan. If you just pay ahead and the lender records it as a regular payment you will not be paying off the debt early and therefore no financial benefit.<br><br>Payment Amount = Principal * ((Interest Rate per Payment * (1 + Interest Rate per Payment) Number of Payments)/(((1 + Interest Rate per Payment)^Number of Payments)-1)) <br><br>Examples: Car Loan, Mortgage, Personal (Signature) Loan, Credit Card, Medical Bill, Student Loans"
